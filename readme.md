## 💡 How It Works

- Mouse **wheel scrolls** horizontally inside the `.gallery` div
- JavaScript detects scroll and applies smooth behavior on button clicks
- CSS `filter` is used for grayscale-on-hover effect

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Using `scrollLeft` to control horizontal scroll via JavaScript
- Enhancing UX with `scrollBehavior` and button-based navigation
- Hiding native scrollbars and customizing gallery appearance
- Creating visually appealing hover effects with CSS transitions
